module SQLite3
  # == Overview
  #
  # The Database class encapsulates a single connection to a SQLite3 database.  Here's a
  # straightforward example of usage:
  #
  #   require 'sqlite3'
  #
  #   SQLite3::Database.new( "data.db" ) do |db|
  #     db.execute( "select * from table" ) do |row|
  #       p row
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # It wraps the lower-level methods provided by the selected driver, and includes the Pragmas
  # module for access to various pragma convenience methods.
  #
  # The Database class provides type translation services as well, by which the SQLite3 data types
  # (which are all represented as strings) may be converted into their corresponding types (as
  # defined in the schemas for their tables). This translation only occurs when querying data from
  # the database--insertions and updates are all still typeless.
  #
  # Furthermore, the Database class has been designed to work well with the ArrayFields module from
  # Ara Howard. If you require the ArrayFields module before performing a query, and if you have not
  # enabled results as hashes, then the results will all be indexible by field name.
  #
  # == Thread safety
  #
  # When SQLite3.threadsafe? returns true, it is safe to share instances of the database class
  # among threads without adding specific locking. Other object instances may require applications
  # to provide their own locks if they are to be shared among threads.  Please see the README.md for
  # more information.
  #
  # == SQLite Extensions
  #
  # SQLite3::Database supports the universe of {sqlite
  # extensions}[https://www.sqlite.org/loadext.html]. It's possible to load an extension into an
  # existing Database object using the #load_extension method and passing a filesystem path:
  #
  #   db = SQLite3::Database.new(":memory:")
  #   db.enable_load_extension(true)
  #   db.load_extension("/path/to/extension")
  #
  # As of v2.4.0, it's also possible to pass an object that responds to +#to_path+. This
  # documentation will refer to the supported interface as +_ExtensionSpecifier+, which can be
  # expressed in RBS syntax as:
  #
  #   interface _ExtensionSpecifier
  #     def to_path: () â†’ String
  #   end
  #
  # So, for example, if you are using the {sqlean gem}[https://github.com/flavorjones/sqlean-ruby]
  # which provides modules that implement this interface, you can pass the module directly:
  #
  #   db = SQLite3::Database.new(":memory:")
  #   db.enable_load_extension(true)
  #   db.load_extension(SQLean::Crypto)
  #
  # It's also possible in v2.4.0+ to load extensions via the SQLite3::Database constructor by using
  # the +extensions:+ keyword argument to pass an array of String paths or extension specifiers:
  #
  #   db = SQLite3::Database.new(":memory:", extensions: ["/path/to/extension", SQLean::Crypto])
  #
  # Note that when loading extensions via the constructor, there is no need to call
  # #enable_load_extension; however it is still necessary to call #enable_load_extensions before any
  # subsequently invocations of #load_extension on the initialized Database object.
  #
  # You can load extensions in a Rails application by using the +extensions:+ configuration option:
  #
  #   # config/database.yml
  #   development:
  #     adapter: sqlite3
  #     extensions:
  #       - .sqlpkg/nalgeon/crypto/crypto.so # a filesystem path
  #       - <%= SQLean::UUID.to_path %>      # or ruby code returning a path
  #
