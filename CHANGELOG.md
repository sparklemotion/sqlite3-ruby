# sqlite3-ruby Changelog

## 2.3.0 / 2024-11-20

### Added

- The SQLITE_DBPAGE extension is now enabled by default, which implements an eponymous-only virtual table that provides direct access to the underlying database file by interacting with the pager. See https://www.sqlite.org/dbpage.html for more information. [#578] @flavorjones
- The DBSTAT extension is now enabled by default, which implements a read-only eponymous virtual table that returns information about the amount of disk space used to store the content of an SQLite database. See https://sqlite.org/dbstat.html for more information. [#580] @pawurb @flavorjones
- `Database#optimize` which wraps the `pragma optimize;` statement. Also added `Constants::Optimize` to allow advanced users to pass a bitmask of options. See https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_optimize. [#572] @alexcwatt @flavorjones
- `SQLite3::VERSION_INFO` is contains a bag of metadata about the gem and the sqlite library used. `SQLite3::SQLITE_PACKAGED_LIBRARIES` and `SQLite3::SQLITE_PRECOMPILED_LIBRARIES` are indicate how the gem was built. [#581] @flavorjones


### Fixed

- `Database#encoding=` support for switching the database encoding to `UTF-16BE`, which has been broken since `Database#encoding=` was introduced in v1.3.12 in 2016. [#575] @miyucy
- Omit mention of the `pkg-config` gem when failing to build from source, since it is not used. [#358] @flavorjones


## 2.2.0 / 2024-10-30

### Added

- URI filenames are now allowed. This allows the injection of some behavior via recognized query parameters. See https://www.sqlite.org/uri.html for more information. [#571] @flavorjones


### Improved

- SQL Syntax errors during `Database#prepare` will raise a verbose exception with a multiline message indicating with a "^" exactly where in the statement the error occurred. [#554] @fractaledmind @flavorjones


## 2.1.1 / 2024-10-22

### Dependencies

- Vendored sqlite is updated to [v3.47.0](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_47_0.html) [#570] @flavorjones


## 2.1.0 / 2024-09-24

### Ruby

- This release drops support for Ruby 3.0. [#563] @flavorjones


### Fork safety improvements

Sqlite itself is [not fork-safe](https://www.sqlite.org/howtocorrupt.html#_carrying_an_open_database_connection_across_a_fork_). Specifically, writing in a child process to a database connection that was created in the parent process may corrupt the database file. To mitigate this risk, sqlite3-ruby has implemented the following changes:

- All open writable database connections carried across a `fork()` will immediately be closed in the child process to mitigate the risk of corrupting the database file.
- These connections will be incompletely closed ("discarded") which will result in a one-time memory leak in the child process.

If it's at all possible, we strongly recommend that you close writable database connections in the parent before forking. If absolutely necessary (and you know what you're doing), you may suppress the fork safety warnings by calling `SQLite3::ForkSafety.suppress_warnings!`.

See the README's "Fork Safety" section and `adr/2024-09-fork-safety.md` for more information. [#558, #565, #566] @flavorjones


### Improved

- Use `sqlite3_close_v2` to close databases in a deferred manner if there are unclosed prepared statements. Previously closing a database while statements were open resulted in a `BusyException`. See https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/close.html for more context. [#557] @flavorjones
- When setting a Database `busy_handler`, fire the write barrier to prevent potential crashes during the GC mark phase. [#556] @jhawthorn


### Documentation

- The `FAQ.md` has been updated to fix some inaccuracies. [#562] @rickhull


## 2.0.4 / 2024-08-13

### Dependencies

- Vendored sqlite is updated to [v3.46.1](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_46_1.html) @flavorjones


## 2.0.3 / 2024-07-29

### Improved

- `Database#quote` avoids allocating strings where reusing frozen strings is preferable. #548 @casperisfine


## 2.0.2 / 2024-05-23

### Dependencies

- Vendored sqlite is updated to [v3.46.0](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_46_0.html) @flavorjones


## 2.0.1 / 2024-04-20

### Fixed

- Raise `ArgumentError` if `Database#execute`, `#execute_batch`, or `#query` are passed multiple bind parameters that are not in an Array. In v2.0.0 these methods would silently swallow additional arguments, and this change makes the failure explicit. See the CHANGELOG notes for v2.0.0 for examples on how to update your code. [#527] @flavorjones
- Fixed a regression in v2.0.0 that caused `Database#execute_batch` to raise an encoding exception when passed some non-ascii strings. As a result of this fix, `Database#prepare` now ensures the "remainder" string will always be encoded as UTF-8. [#524] @flavorjones


## 2.0.0 / 2024-04-17

This is a major release which contains some breaking changes, primarily the removal of
long-deprecated functionality. Before upgrading, please make sure to address deprecation warnings
emitted from your application using sqlite3-ruby v1.7.x.


### Ruby

- This release drops support for Ruby 2.7. [#453] @flavorjones


### Packaging

See [the INSTALLATION doc](https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md) for more information.


### Dependencies

- Vendored sqlite is updated to [v3.45.3](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_45_3.html). @flavorjones


### Added

- `Database#busy_handler_timeout=` introduced as an alternative to `#busy_timeout=` that can be used when it's desired to release the GVL between retries. [#443, #456] @fractaledmind
- Support the `SUPER_JOURNAL` flag which is an alias for `MASTER_JOURNAL` as of sqlite 3.33.0. [#467] @flavorjones
- `Statement#stat` and `Statement#memused` introduced to report statistics. [#461] @fractaledmind
- `Statement#sql` and `Statement#expanded_sql` introduced to retrieve the SQL statement associated with the `Statement` object. [#293, #498] @tenderlove
- `SQLite3.status` introduced to return run-time status and reset high-water marks. See `SQLite3::Constants::Status` for details. [#520] @wjlroe


### Improved

- Avoid leaking memory for statements that are not closed properly. [#392] @haileys
- Moved some C code into Ruby. [#451, #455] @tenderlove
- Improve performance of `ResultSet` hashes. [#154, #484, #468] @tenderlove
- Fix a GC compaction issue with `busy_handler`. [#466] @byroot
- Remove unused `ResultSet` instance variable. [#469] @tenderlove
- Fix encoding for values passed to custom functions. [#218, #488] @tenderlove


### Changed

- Consistently use `SQLite3::Exception` or subclasses. Previously some `Pragmas` methods raised `Exception`, and `Database#execute_batch2` and `Database#load_extension` raised `RuntimeError`. [#467, #490] @flavorjones
- `Database#columns` returns a list of internal frozen strings. [#155, #474, #486] @tenderlove
- Freeze results that come from the database. [#480] @tenderlove
- The encoding of a Database is no longer cached. [#485] @tenderlove
- `Database#transaction` returns the result of the block when used with a block. [#508] @alexcwatt
- `Database#execute_batch` returns the result of the last statement executed. [#512] @alexcwatt


### Removed

- Removed class `SQLite3::Translator` and all related type translation methods which have been deprecated since v1.3.2. [#470] @tenderlove

  If you need to do type translation on values returned from the statement object, please wrap it
  with a delegate object.  Here is an example of using a delegate class to implement type
  translation:

  ```ruby
  require "sqlite3"
  require "delegate"

  db = SQLite3::Database.new(":memory:")

  return_value = db.execute_batch2 <<-EOSQL
          CREATE TABLE items (id integer PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name string);
          INSERT INTO items (name) VALUES ("foo");
          INSERT INTO items (name) VALUES ("bar");
  EOSQL

  class MyTranslator < DelegateClass(SQLite3::Statement)
    def step
      row = super
      return if done?

      row.map.with_index do |item, i|
        case types[i]
        when "integer" # turn all integers to floats
          item.to_f
        when "string" # add "hello" to all strings
          item + "hello"
        end
      end
    end
  end

  db.prepare("SELECT * FROM items") do |stmt|
    stmt = MyTranslator.new(stmt)
    while row = stmt.step
      p row
    end
  end
  ```

- Removed `types` and `fields` readers on row objects, which have been deprecated since
  v1.3.6. [#471] @tenderlove

  Deprecated code looks like this:

  ```ruby
  row = @db.execute("select * from foo")
  assert_equal ["blob"], row.first.types
  ```

  If you would like to access the "types" associated with a returned query,
  use a prepared statement like this:

  ```ruby
  @db.prepare("select * from foo") do |v|
    assert_equal ["blob"], v.types
  end
  ```

- Removed support for non-Array bind parameters to methods `Database#execute`, `#execute_batch`, and `#query`, which has been deprecated since v1.3.0. [#511] @flavorjones

  Deprecated code looks like this:

  ``` ruby
  @db.query("select * from foo where a = ? and b = ? and c = ?", 1, 2, 3)
  ```

  For these cases, pass the bind parameters as an array:

  ``` ruby
  @db.query("select * from foo where a = ? and b = ? and c = ?", [1, 2, 3])
  ```

- Removed class `SQLite3::VersionProxy` which has been deprecated since v1.3.2. [#453] @flavorjones
- Removed methods `SQLite3::Database::FunctionProxy#count` and `#set_error` which have been broken since at least v1.3.13. [#164, #509, #510] @alexcwatt @flavorjones


## 1.7.3 / 2024-03-15

### Dependencies

- Vendored sqlite is updated to [v3.45.2](https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_45_2.html). @flavorjones


## 1.7.2 / 2024-01-30

### Dependencies

- Vendored sqlite is updated to [v3.45.1](https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_45_1.html). @flavorjones


## 1.7.1 / 2024-01-24

### Dependencies

- Vendored sqlite is updated to [v3.45.0](https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_45_0.html). @flavorjones


## 1.7.0 / 2023-12-27

### Ruby

This release introduces native gem support for Ruby 3.3.

This release ends native gem support for Ruby 2.7, for which [upstream support ended 2023-03-31](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/). Ruby 2.7 is still generally supported, but will not be shipped in the native gems.

This release ends support for Ruby 1.9.3, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6.

### Improved

- SQLite3::Statement, Database, and Backup objects have been converted to use the TypedData API. See https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19998 for more context. [#432] @casperisfine


## 1.6.9 / 2023-11-26

### Dependencies

- Vendored sqlite is update to [v3.44.2](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_44_2.html). @flavorjones

### Added

- `Database.new` now accepts a `:default_transaction_mode` option (defaulting to `:deferred`), and `Database#transaction` no longer requires a transaction mode to be specified. This should allow higher-level adapters to more easily choose a transaction mode for a database connection. [#426] @masamitsu-murase


## 1.6.8 / 2023-11-01

### Dependencies

- Vendored sqlite is updated to [v3.44.0](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_44_0.html). @flavorjones
- rake-compiler-dock updated to v1.3.1 for precompiled native gems. @flavorjones


### Added

- `SQLite3::Database.open` now returns the block result. Previously this returned the Database object. [#415] @toy
- Documentation improvement in `lib/sqlite3/database.rb`. [#421] @szTheory


## 1.6.7 / 2023-10-10

### Dependencies

Vendored sqlite is updated to [v3.43.2](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_43_2.html).

Upstream release notes:

> - Fix a couple of obscure UAF errors and an obscure memory leak.
> - Omit the use of the sprintf() function from the standard library in the [CLI](https://sqlite.org/cli.html), as this now generates warnings on some platforms.
> - Avoid conversion of a double into unsigned long long integer, as some platforms do not do such conversions correctly.


### Added

* Compile packaged sqlite3 with additional flags to explicitly enable FTS5, and set synchronous mode to normal when in WAL mode. [#408] (@flavorjones)


## 1.6.6 / 2023-09-12

### Dependencies

Vendored sqlite is updated to [v3.43.1](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_43_1.html).

Upstream release notes:

> - Fix a regression in the way that the [sum()](https://sqlite.org/lang_aggfunc.html#sumunc), [avg()](https://sqlite.org/lang_aggfunc.html#avg), and [total()](https://sqlite.org/lang_aggfunc.html#sumunc) aggregate functions handle infinities.
> - Fix a bug in the [json_array_length()](https://sqlite.org/json1.html#jarraylen) function that occurs when the argument comes directly from [json_remove()](https://sqlite.org/json1.html#jrm).
> - Fix the omit-unused-subquery-columns optimization (introduced in in version 3.42.0) so that it works correctly if the subquery is a compound where one arm is DISTINCT and the other is not.
> - Other minor fixes.


## 1.6.5 / 2023-09-08

### Packaging

* Allow setting compiler flags for the sqlite library via a `--with-sqlite-cflags` argument to `extconf.rb`. See [`INSTALLATION.md`](https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md#controlling-compilation-flags-for-sqlite) for more information. [#401, #402] (@flavorjones)


## 1.6.4 / 2023-08-26

### Dependencies

Vendored sqlite is updated to [v3.43.0](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_43_0.html).

Upstream release notes:

> SQLite Release 3.43.0 On 2023-08-24
> * Add support for Contentless-Delete FTS5 Indexes. This is a variety of FTS5 full-text search index that omits storing the content that is being indexed while also allowing records to be deleted.
> * Enhancements to the date and time functions:
>   * Added new time shift modifiers of the form ±YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS.
>   * Added the timediff() SQL function.
> * Added the octet_length(X) SQL function.
> * Added the sqlite3_stmt_explain() API.
> * Query planner enhancements:
>   * Generalize the LEFT JOIN strength reduction optimization so that it works for RIGHT and FULL JOINs as well. Rename it to OUTER JOIN strength reduction.
>   * Enhance the theorem prover in the OUTER JOIN strength reduction optimization so that it returns fewer false-negatives.
> * Enhancements to the decimal extension:
>   * New function decimal_pow2(N) returns the N-th power of 2 for integer N between -20000 and +20000.
>   * New function decimal_exp(X) works like decimal(X) except that it returns the result in exponential notation - with a "e+NN" at the end.
>   * If X is a floating-point value, then the decimal(X) function now does a full expansion of that value into its exact decimal equivalent.
> * Performance enhancements to JSON processing results in a 2x performance improvement for some kinds of processing on large JSON strings.
> * New makefile target "verify-source" checks to ensure that there are no unintentional changes in the source tree. (Works for canonical source code only - not for precompiled amalgamation tarballs.)
> * Added the SQLITE_USE_SEH compile-time option that enables Structured Exception Handling on Windows while working with the memory-mapped shm file that is part of WAL mode processing. This option is enabled by default when building on Windows using Makefile.msc.
> * The VFS for unix now assumes that the nanosleep() system call is available unless compiled with -DHAVE_NANOSLEEP=0.


## 1.6.3 / 2023-05-16

### Dependencies

Vendored sqlite is updated to [v3.42.0](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_42_0.html).

From the release announcement:

> This is a regular enhancement release.  The main new features are:
> * SQLite will now parse and understand JSON5, though it is careful to generate only pure, canonical JSON.
> * The secure-delete option has been added to the FTS5 extension.


## 1.6.2 / 2023-03-27

### Dependencies

Vendored sqlite is updated from v3.41.0 to [v3.41.2](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_41_2.html).


### Packaging

* Allow compilation against system libraries without the presence of `mini_portile2`, primarily for the convenience of linux distro repackagers. [#381] (Thank you, @voxik!)


## 1.6.1 / 2023-02-22

### Dependencies

* Vendored sqlite is updated to [v3.41.0](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_41_0.html).


## 1.6.0 / 2023-01-13

### Ruby

This release introduces native gem support for Ruby 3.2.

This release ends native gem support for Ruby 2.6, for which [upstream support ended 2022-04-12](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/).


### Dependencies

* Vendored sqlite3 is updated to [v3.40.1](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_40_1.html).


### Fixes

* `get_boolean_pragma` now returns the correct value. Previously, it always returned true. [#275] (Thank you, @Edouard-chin!)


## 1.5.4 / 2022-11-18

### Dependencies

* Vendored sqlite is updated to [v3.40.0](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_40_0.html).


## 1.5.3 / 2022-10-11

### Fixed

* Fixed installation of the "ruby" platform gem when building from source on Fedora. In v1.5.0..v1.5.2, installation failed on some systems due to the behavior of Fedora's pkg-config implementation. [#355]


## 1.5.2 / 2022-10-01

### Packaging

This version correctly vendors the tarball for sqlite v3.39.4 in the vanilla "ruby" platform gem package, so that users will not require network access at installation.

v1.5.0 and v1.5.1 mistakenly packaged the tarball for sqlite v3.38.5 in the vanilla "ruby" platform gem, resulting in downloading the intended tarball over the network at installation time (or, if the network was not available, failure to install). Note that the precompiled native gems were not affected by this issue. [#352]


## 1.5.1 / 2022-09-29

### Dependencies

* Vendored sqlite is updated to [v3.39.4](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_39_4.html).

### Security

The vendored version of sqlite, v3.39.4, should be considered to be a security release. From the release notes:

> Version 3.39.4 is a minimal patch against the prior release that addresses issues found since the
> prior release. In particular, a potential vulnerability in the FTS3 extension has been fixed, so
> this should be considered a security update.
>
> In order to exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must have full SQL access and must be able to
> construct a corrupt database with over 2GB of FTS3 content. The problem arises from a 32-bit
> signed integer overflow.

For more information please see [GHSA-mgvv-5mxp-xq67](https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby/security/advisories/GHSA-mgvv-5mxp-xq67).


## 1.5.0 / 2022-09-08

### Packaging

#### Faster, more reliable installation

Native (precompiled) gems are available for Ruby 2.6, 2.7, 3.0, and 3.1 on all these platforms:

- `aarch64-linux`
- `arm-linux`
- `arm64-darwin`
- `x64-mingw32` and `x64-mingw-ucrt`
- `x86-linux`
- `x86_64-darwin`
- `x86_64-linux`

If you are using one of these Ruby versions on one of these platforms, the native gem is the recommended way to install sqlite3-ruby.

See [the README](https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby#native-gems-recommended) for more information.


#### More consistent developer experience

Both the native (precompiled) gems and the vanilla "ruby platform" (source) gem include sqlite v3.39.3 by default.

Defaulting to a consistent version of sqlite across all systems means that your development environment behaves exactly like your production environment, and you have access to the latest and greatest features of sqlite.

You can opt-out of the packaged version of sqlite (and use your system-installed library as in versions < 1.5.0). See [the README](https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby#avoiding-the-precompiled-native-gem) for more information.
